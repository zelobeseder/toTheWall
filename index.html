				<h1>1. The list</h1>
 				<h2>February 2017. Ostkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>About 40 years old man wearing thick framed glasses explained to me in detail how I could get to the wall. I gave him a stack of sheets with our workshop program, which Alex Heide had given us on the 22 of February 2017. He wrote the route on the otherside of it.</p>

				<h1>2. The map</h1>
 				<h2>25 February 2017. Westkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>I have been standing in the centre of the platform for a pretty long period of time peering into a map. A man, appeared to be in his 50’, walked toward my direction. He gave me his map. I told him, that I wanted to get to the wall. He wrote train numbers on the map and marked stations to switch he also marked some location which he thought are worth visiting as a tourist.</p>

				<h1>3. The note on the photo</h1>
 				<h2>27 February 2017. Ostkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>A girl in her 20’ wearing black glasses, big scarf and headphones. She mentioned several stations where I could see the wall and I didn't remember any of them and asked her to write them down. She didn't have anything to write on, so I gave her the picture I had made on 26-th of February 2017. It was Ostkreuz written on one side, she wrote Warschauer Straße on the other side of it.</p>

				<h1>4. The scheme</h1>
 				<h2>27 February 2017. Westkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>A man about 40 years old told me if I wanted to get to the most interesting part of the wall, I had to get to Ostbahnhof station. He took a piece of paper and draw a map. Just before we parted he said: it would be great.</p>

				<h1>5. The note on the hand</h1>
 				<h2>28 February 2017. Westkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>A young lady with a baby in a baby carrier. I asked her how I could get to the wall. She told me I needed to get to Friedrichstraße. I asked her to write it on my hand. I still don't know if she meant the street or the station.</p>

				<h1>6. The note on the box</h1>
 				<h2>1 March 2017. Ostkreuz station.</h2> 
				<p>Teenager, most probably a student. I asked him how I could get to the wall. He said that the easiest way was to get to the Warschauer Straße. He wrote the name on an empty polaroid cassette box I gave him. He was the first person to sent me to the place I've already been. In that moment I understood that the circle is completed.</p>
